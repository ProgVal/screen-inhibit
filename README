This is a Cinnamon applet, which Enables or Disables your screensaver with the click of the icon.

This currently should work with gnome-screensaver as well as xscreensaver.  If there are more you want me to add then specify in the comments.


Left-clicking the icon will disable the screensaver (and change the icon).  Left-clicking again should restart the process.


Installation
================
	
	1) Unzip, copy the folder "screen-inhibit@mtwebster" to "~/.local/share/cinnamon/applets/".
	
	2) Enable the applet in cinnamon settings.
